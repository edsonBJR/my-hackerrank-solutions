 *	Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.
 *	For example, the square matrix  is shown below:
 *
 * 	2 3 4 
 *  9 8 7
 *  4 9 0
 *  
 *  The left-to-right diagonal = 2 + 8 + 0. The right to left diagonal = 4 + 8 + 4. Their absolute difference is 10 - 16.
